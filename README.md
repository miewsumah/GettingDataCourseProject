# GettingDataCourseProject
This repository is created for the Peer Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

Review criteria
1. submit a tidy data set 
2. submit the script for performing the analysis
3. submit a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4. submit a README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

Files in this repository:
1.CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

2.run_analysis.R is a script that performs the data preparation of the 5 steps as described in the course projectâ€™s definition: 
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3.tidydata.txt is the final data after going through all the sequences described above.
